Description: [incr Tcl] OOP extension for Tcl - run-time files
 [incr Tcl] (or itcl) is a popular object-oriented extension for the
 embeddable Tcl scripting language.  The name is a play on C++, and

 public and private classes and variables.  Unlike most OOP extensions
 to Tcl, itcl is written in C for speed.

Earlier packages of itcl/itk were given names like "itcl3.1", and were
tied to specific versions of tcl/tk.  This version uses the "stubs",
which is supposed to make it independent of the version of tcl/tk in
use.  That's the theory.  In practice, because of internal incompatibilities
between tcl8.4 and tcl8.5 thish package works with tcl8.4 if built with
tcl8.4, and works with tcl8.5 and tcl8.6 if built with tcl8.5.
